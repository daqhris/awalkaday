 bio: "Explore the beautiful world captured in the awalkaday.art photography collection. 
 A collection of black and white photographs showcasing the beauty of the natural landscapes and architectural marvels of Belgium (Europe). 
 Photographer Chris-Armel (daqhris) made each piece as an homage to the pleasures of walking in nature, capturing the magnificence and secrets that surround us. 
 Immerse yourself in the collection and embark on a stunning visual journey of exploration. 
 Each photo is uniquely identified and certified through a token on the Ethereum blockchain. 
 The smart contract of the art project, named 'awalkaday.art', was released on-chain in February 2023, and it allows you to buy artwork from the photography collection."
