 bio: "Explore a collection of black-and-white photographs that artfully capture the natural landscapes and architectural wonders of Belgium, Europe and encourages everyone to go out and walk. 
 Chris-Armel (daqhris) crafted each piece as a tribute to the joys of walking in nature, capturing the magnificence and mysteries that surround us. 
 Feel free to immerse yourself in the photo series on awalkaday.art. Let's embark on a stunning journey of visual exploration! 
 Each photograph is assigned a unique identification token on the Ethereum blockchain, certifying its authenticity. 
 In February 2023, a smart contract named awalkaday.art was deployed on the blockchain, facilitating the purchase of artwork(s) from this unique collection of 263 photographs."
