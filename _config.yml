  Letâ€™s explore a collection of black-and-white photographs that artfully depict the natural landscapes and architectural wonders of Belgium (Europe) and encourage everyone to get out and walk.<br>
  Chris-Armel (daqhris) photographed each piece as a tribute to the joys of walking in nature, capturing a snapshot at first glance of fascinating sights discovered by chance in a land of refuge away from tyranny. This collection of photographs has been in the making since the year 2021, based on an inspiring idea from 2017.<br>
  Each photograph has been assigned a unique identification token on the Ethereum blockchain to certify its authenticity. In February 2023, an eponymous smart contract was published on the blockchain to facilitate the purchase of artworks from this unique collection of 263 photographs.<br>
  Feel free to immerse yourself in the company of ageless but time-bound photographic memories on display in this self-built digital venue. Let's enjoy a breathtaking journey of visual exploration together!
