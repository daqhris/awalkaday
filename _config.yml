 bio: "Explore a collection of black and white photographs that artfully capture the natural landscapes and architectural wonders of Belgium and Europe, and encourage everyone to get out and walk. 
 Chris-Armel (daqhris) created each piece as a tribute to the joys of walking in nature, capturing the wonders and mysteries that surround us. 
 Feel free to immerse yourself in the photo series on awalkaday.art. Let's go on a breathtaking journey of visual exploration! 
 Each photo is assigned a unique identification token on the Ethereum blockchain, which certifies its authenticity. 
 In February 2023, a smart contract called awalkaday.art was deployed on the blockchain to facilitate the purchase of artworks from this unique collection of 263 photographs."
