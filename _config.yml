 bio: "A collection of black-and-white photographs showcasing the beauty of the natural landscapes and architectural wonders of Belgium (Europe). 
 Photographer Chris-Armel (daqhris) created each piece as a tribute to the joys of walking in nature, capturing the magnificence and mysteries that surround us. 
 Immerse yourself in the collection and embark on a stunning visual journey of exploration. 
 Each photo is uniquely identified and certified by a token on the Ethereum blockchain. 
 The art project's smart contract, named awalkaday.art, was published on the blockchain in February 2023 and allows for the purchase of artwork from the photo collection."
