  Let's go on a visual journey through a collection of black-and-white photographs depicting the natural landscapes and architectural wonders of Belgium (Europe). The photographs are intended to inspire you to get out and walk. <br>
  Created by Chris-Armel (daqhris), the artworks pay tribute to the joys of walking in nature and capture fascinating sights discovered by chance in a country of refuge far from tyranny. Immerse yourself in a digital venue that showcases ageless and time-bound photographic memories. <br>
  The collection of photographs, known as awalkaday.art, has been a public project in constant evolution since 2017-2018. It was re-launched in 2021, with the process of photographing coming to an end a year later. Each photograph has a unique identification token on the Ethereum blockchain, which certifies its authenticity. In February 2023, a smart contract named after the collection was published on the blockchain to facilitate the collection of artworks from this series of 263 photographs.
