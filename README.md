## Highlights
1. __Easy__ setup and __free__ digital art gallery web app.
2. __No complex code__ changes required. Just upload your pictures to the repository.
3. __Responsive & fast__ display for __web and mobile__ devices.

## Quick Start
If you have basic knowledge about web development and you like photography, then this open-source project may help you setup a web application to showcase all your creations without much effort.  

**Follow the steps below and your website would be live in no time:**

1. Fork this repo by hitting the `Fork` button at the top right corner.
2. Enable _Github Pages_ from the repo settings.
3. Upload your pictures to `images` directory. (You may do that on github.com itself or you may clone and push the images to your repo.)
4. Add your own custom domain in `CNAME` file or just remove the file if you don't own a domain and use the default domain that GitHub provides.
5. Update `baseurl` field in `_config.yml` file with whatever domain you used in step #4.
6. And that's it, your web application is set. To view, go to [beta.awalkaday.art](https://beta.awalkaday.art) (or whatever you have in the CNAME file) and if you don't have one, you can go to [[yourusername].github.io/awalkaday](https://yourusername.github.io/awalkaday).

And, of course, you can modify the words that are shown on the landing page's footer in `_config.yml` file as well as few other settings like your social media icons, contact form, etc.

## Tips
The website is set up as a [npm](https://www.npmjs.com) package with [gulp](https://gulpjs.com/) to automate image resizing and thumbnail generation.   
You can just do the following before you push your images to GitHub:

1. Fork and then clone the project to your computer.
2. Go inside the project's local folder `$ cd awalkaday`.
3. Install all dependencies by running `$ npm install`. This step might take some time while automatically downloading and installing recent versions of [NodeJS](https://nodejs.org/en/), [ImageMagick](https://imagemagick.org/index.php), [Git](https://git-scm.com/), [Python](https://www.python.org/), Build Tools for your IDE like [Node.js for Visual Studio](https://visualstudio.microsoft.com/vs/features/node-js/) and other required dependencies.
4. Copy all your pictures (if possible in JPG file format, the largest size available, straight from your camera or original files) and put them inside `images` directory.
5. Run `$ gulp` on the command-line inside the git folder in order to resize the images and to generate thumbnails.
6. Push your local changes to _github.com_ by using `$ git add --all`, then send a [signed commit](https://docs.github.com/en/github/authenticating-to-github/managing-commit-signature-verification/signing-commits) `$ git commit -S -m "a short and descriptive commit message"` and finally update your remote code repo on GitHub by using `$ git push origin master`.
