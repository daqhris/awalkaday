 bio: >
  Let's embark on a thrilling journey through a collection of black-and-white photographs depicting the natural landscapes and architectural wonders of Belgium (Europe), which will inspire you to get out and walk. <br><br>
  Created by Chris-Armel (daqhris), the visual artworks pay tribute to the joys of walking in nature and capture fascinating sights discovered, by chance and on foot, in a country of refuge far from tyranny. Feel free to immerse yourself in a self-constructed digital venue that showcases ageless and time-bound photographic memories. <br><br>
  The collection of photographs, known as awalkaday.art, has been a public project in constant evolution since 2017-2018. It was relaunched in 2021, and the process of photography came to an end one year later. In February 2023, a smart contract was self-published on the Ethereum blockchain to facilitate the collection of artworks from this series of 263 photographs.
